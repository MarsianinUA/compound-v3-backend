# Services Layer

## Overview

The services layer is designed to contain general processing logic that is reusable across the application.  
This layer plays a crucial role in maintaining a clean and organized structure as the project scales.

## Key Responsibilities

* Encapsulate business logic that is not tied to any specific feature.
* Provide services that can be leveraged by controllers, features, and other layers without creating circular dependencies.
* Ensure separation of concerns by isolating reusable logic from other parts of the application.

## Usage Guidelines

### Structure

The services folder should house individual service folders, each responsible for a specific piece of functionality.  

For instance:

services/  
├── email  
├── health  
├── user  

### Best Practices

* Avoid Feature-Specific Logic: Ensure that the logic within this layer is not tightly coupled with specific application features.
* Reuse Across Layers: Services should be designed for use across specific controllers, features, or other higher-level layers.
* Dependency Injection: Leverage dependency injection to manage service dependencies and facilitate testing.
